ok this is really good, do you think we can refactor the App.tsx anymore or do you think its in a good place, there does still seem to be a quite
   a bit of logic in there though that might be hard to test in isoltion

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about further refactoring App.tsx. Let me think about this - they've opened the file and are asking if we can refactor it more, 
  noting that there's still quite a bit of logic that might be hard to test in isolation.

  Looking at the current App.tsx structure:
  1. It's 717 lines (down from 1096) which is still quite large
  2. It has a lot of different responsibilities:
    - URL state management
    - Data fetching logic
    - Multiple useEffect hooks for different concerns
    - Event handlers for different actions
    - State management for the entire app

  Areas that could be extracted for better testability:
  1. URL state management - could be a custom hook useUrlState
  2. Data fetching logic - could be multiple custom hooks like useProjectData, useEventsData, etc.
  3. Event handlers - could be grouped into custom hooks by concern
  4. State management - could use a reducer pattern or context

  The main issues I see:
  - Multiple useEffect hooks doing different things
  - Large state object that's hard to test
  - Mixed concerns (URL management, data fetching, event handling)
  - Event handlers that are complex and hard to test in isolation

  I should suggest specific refactoring opportunities that would improve testability and separation of concerns.

● You're absolutely right! While we've made great progress (717 lines vs 1096), there's still quite a bit of complex logic that would be hard to
  test in isolation. Let me analyze the current App.tsx and suggest some strategic refactoring opportunities.

✻ Thinking…

  Looking at the current App.tsx, I can identify several areas where we can extract logic to make it more testable and maintainable:

  1. URL State Management (Lines 102-223) - This is complex logic that manages URL synchronization, local storage, project selection. This could be 
  extracted into a useUrlState or useAppRouting hook.
  2. Data Fetching Logic (Lines 225-315) - The large useEffect that fetches groups, events, releases, rules, health, etc. This could be broken into 
  multiple custom hooks like:
    - useProjectData(selected, filters) 
    - useEventsData(selected, filters, pagination)
    - etc.
  3. Event Handlers (Lines 343-607) - There are many event handlers that could be grouped by concern:
    - Project management: createProject, setSelected
    - Event management: sendEvent, fetchEvent 
    - Release management: createRelease, createDeployment
    - Alert management: createRule, updateFirstRule, snoozeGroup
  4. State Management - The large AppState interface and useState could potentially benefit from useReducer pattern for better testability.
  5. State Setters (Lines 544-607) - These are boilerplate and could be handled differently.

  Let me suggest a specific refactoring plan.

● Let me analyze the current App.tsx structure and identify refactoring opportunities:

  🔍 Current App.tsx Analysis (717 lines)

  Major Logic Blocks:

  1. URL State Management (Lines 102-223) - Complex routing/URL sync logic
  2. Data Fetching (Lines 225-315) - Large useEffect with multiple API calls
  3. Event Handlers (Lines 343-542) - 12+ different handler functions
  4. State Setters (Lines 544-607) - Boilerplate state setters

  🎯 Strategic Refactoring Opportunities

  1. Extract URL/Routing Logic (Highest Impact)
  // hooks/useAppRouting.ts
  const useAppRouting = (projects, selected) => {
    // Handle all URL initialization, project selection, localStorage
    // Returns: { activeTab, setActiveTab, selectedProject, setSelectedProject }
  }

  2. Extract Data Fetching Hooks (High Impact)
  // hooks/useProjectData.ts  
  const useProjectData = (selected, filters, range, timeSel) => {
    // Handle groups, events, releases, rules, health, deploys, series
    // Returns: { groups, events, releases, rules, health, deploys, series }
  }

  3. Extract Service Hooks by Domain (Medium Impact)
  // hooks/useProjectService.ts
  const useProjectService = () => ({
    createProject,
    sendEvent,
    fetchEvent
  })

  // hooks/useReleaseService.ts  
  const useReleaseService = (selected) => ({
    createRelease,
    createDeployment,
    sendSession
  })

  // hooks/useAlertService.ts
  const useAlertService = (selected) => ({
    createRule,
    updateFirstRule,
    snoozeGroup
  })

  4. State Management Refactoring (Lower Impact, but cleaner)
  // Consider useReducer for complex state updates
  // Or Context API for deeply nested prop drilling

  🚀 Recommended Next Steps

  Phase 1: Extract URL Management
  - Would reduce App.tsx by ~120 lines
  - Most complex, hard-to-test logic
  - Clear separation of concerns

  Phase 2: Extract Data Fetching
  - Would reduce App.tsx by ~90 lines
  - Makes data fetching testable in isolation
  - Cleaner dependency management

  Phase 3: Extract Service Hooks
  - Would reduce App.tsx by ~200 lines
  - Makes business logic testable
  - Better separation by domain

  Result: App.tsx could be ~300 lines focused purely on:
  - Hook orchestration
  - Component rendering
  - Clean, testable architecture

  Would you like me to start with Phase 1 (URL Management) extraction? It would have the biggest impact on testability and complexity reduction.

> yes

● Great choice! The URL management logic is the most complex and hard to test. Let me extract it into a dedicated hook.

● Write(hooks/useAppRouting.ts)
  ⎿  Wrote 265 lines to hooks/useAppRouting.ts               
     import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'

       NavigationTab,
       TimeSelection,

       TimeRange,
       TimeInterval
     } from '../types/app.types'

● I need to update the initialState and remove all the routing-related fields since they're now handled by the routing hook. Let me fix this
  systematically:

● I need to completely replace the old App component implementation with one that uses the routing hook. Let me do this in chunks to avoid too
  many errors at once:

● Update(App.tsx)
  ⎿  Updated App.tsx with 3 additions                                    
       68    export const App = () => {
       69      const { projects, reload } = useProjects()
       70      const [state, setState] = useState<AppState>(initialState)
       71 +    
       72 +    // Use routing hook for all URL/routing state
       73 +    const routing = useAppRouting(projects)
       74    
       75      // URL initialization
       76      useEffect(() => {
  ⎿  Found 165 new diagnostic issues in 1 file (ctrl-r to expand)

● The refactor is too complex to do incrementally. Let me create a completely new App.tsx file that properly uses the routing hook:
